# Welcome

Welcome to the Skill Samurai Prompt Engineering Course.

Prompt engineering (PE) is the process of **communicating effectively with an AI to achieve desired results**. As AI technology continues to rapidly advance, the ability to master prompt engineering has become a particularly valuable skill. Prompt engineering techniques can be applied to a wide variety of tasks, making it a useful tool for anyone seeking to improve their efficiency in both everyday and innovative activities.

This course is designed for **beginners**, making it the perfect starting point if you're new to AI and PE. However, even if you're not a beginner, you'll still find valuable insights within this course. This course is the **most comprehensive** prompt engineering course available, and the content ranges from an introduction to AI to advanced PE techniques.

## Ethos and Philosophy

This course is a mix of lessons and practical prompting projects.

### How we teach

Our approach to teaching prompt engineering is guided by the following principles:

**Quick Iterations**â€”Since new PE content is published almost daily, we'll keep this course up-to-date with frequent, concise articles about emerging techniques.

**Emphasis on Practicality**â€”Our focus is on practical techniques that you can start using right away.

**Accessible Examples**â€”To help you grasp the techniques quickly, we'll provide clear, relevant examples throughout the articles.


## How to read

There's no need to read all chapters in order; feel free to explore what interests you! If you're new to AI, machine learning, and programming, we suggest starting with the [Basics](https://learnprompting.org/docs/category/-basics) section and the [Instructions](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/intro) guide. For those already familiar with these concepts, the [Intermediate](https://learnprompting.org/docs/category/%EF%B8%8F-intermediate) section is a great place to dive in and expand your knowledge.

### Article rating system

We've implemented a rating system for articles based on their level of difficulty and the extent of programming knowledge needed:

ðŸŸ¢ Beginner-friendly; no programming required

ðŸŸ¡ Easy; basic programming knowledge necessary, but no specialized expertise

ðŸ”´ Intermediate; programming skills and some domain knowledge required (e.g., calculating logarithmic probabilities)

ðŸŸ£ Advanced; programming expertise and in-depth domain understanding needed (e.g., reinforcement learning techniques)

Please note that even for ðŸ”´ and ðŸŸ£ articles, you can generally grasp the content without prior domain expertise, though it may be helpful for implementation.

### Chapters

Below is a brief overview of each chapter:

**Basics**: Introduction to prompt engineering and fundamental techniques

**Basic Applications**: Simple, practical applications of prompt engineering

**Intermediate**: Research-based PE techniques with moderate complexity

**Applied Prompting**: Comprehensive PE process walkthroughs contributed by community members

**Advanced Applications**: Powerful, and more complex applications of prompt engineering

**Reliability**: Enhancing the reliability of large language models (LLMs)

**Images**: Prompt engineering for text-to-image models, such as DALLE and Stable Diffusion

**Prompt Injection**: Hacking, but for prompt engineering

**Tooling**: A review of various prompt engineering tools and IDEs

**Prompt Tuning**: Refining prompts using gradient-based techniques

**Miscellaneous**: A collection of additional topics and techniques related to prompt engineering
